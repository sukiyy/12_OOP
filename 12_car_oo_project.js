/* Part One
Create a class for vehicle. Each vehicle instance should have the following properties:

-make
-model
-year

--

Each vehicle instance should have access to a method called honk, which returns the string “Beep.”

let myFirstVehicle = new Vehicle("Honda", "Monster Truck", 1999);
myFirstVehicle.honk(); // "Beep."

--

Each vehicle instance should have a method called toString, which returns the string containing the 
make, model and year.

let myFirstVehicle = new Vehicle("Honda", "Monster Truck", 1999);
myFirstVehicle.toString(); // "The vehicle is a Honda Monster Truck from 1999."

  constructor(make, model, year) {
    this.make = make;
    this.model = model;
    this.year = year;
  }

  honk() {
    return "Beep.";
  }

  toString() {
    return `The vehicle is a ${this.make} ${this.model} from ${this.year}.`;
  }
}

/*  Part Two
Create a class for a car. The Car class should inherit from Vehicle and each car instance should 
have a property called numWheels which has a value of 4.

Cars are a type of vehicle with 4 wheels. 
*/

class Car extends Vehicle {
  constructor(make, model, year) {
    super(make, model, year);
    this.numWheels = 4;
  }
}

/*  Part Three
Create a class for a Motorcycle. This class should inherit from Vehicle and each motorcycle instance 
should have a property called numWheels which has a value of 2. It should also have a revEngine method 
which returns “VROOM!!!”

Cars are a type of vehicle with 2 wheels. 
*/
class Motorcycle extends Vehicle {
  constructor(make, model, year) {
    super(make, model, year);
    this.numWheels = 2;
  }

  revEngine() {
    return "VROOM!!!";
  }
}

/*  Part Four
Create a class for a Garage. It should have a property called vehicles which will store an array of 
vehicles, and a property called capacity which is a number indicating how many vehicles will fit in 
the garage. When you create a garage, vehicles will always be empty; you only need to provide the 
capacity.

A garage should also have an add method, which attempts to add a vehicle to the array of vehicles. 
However, if you try to add something which is not a vehicle, the garage should return the message 
“Only vehicles are allowed in here!”. Also, if the garage is at capacity, it should say “Sorry, 
we’re full.”
*/
class Garage {
  constructor(capacity) {
    this.vehicles = [];
    this.capacity = capacity;
  }

  add(newVehicle) {
    if (!(newVehicle instanceof Vehicle)) {
      return "Only vehicles are allowed in here!";
    }
    if (this.vehicles.length >= this.capacity) {
      return "Sorry, we're full.";
    }
